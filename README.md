Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a consulting company that specializes in financial planning. They wanted to bring their operations up-to-date and enhance their web application security. Artemis Financial wanted to add a file verification step using checksums to ensure secure data transfer.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?

To address their security concerns, I implemented industry-standard encryption algorithms, deployed a certificate for the HTTPS protocol, and conducted vulnerability testing to ensure the implemented security measures were in place and functional. Secure coding is very important because it helps to protect sensitive data, maintain client trust, and mitigate financial and reputational risks for both the company and its clients.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

The vulnerability assessment process was helpful in identifying potential security vulnerabilities and providing ways to reduce these weaknesses. Although implementing and mitigating those vulnerabilities was a bit challenging at times,.

How did you increase the layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

To increase layers of security, I implemented AES encryption (SHA-256), deployed a certificate for an HTTPS protocol, and conducted vulnerability testing to ensure the implemented security measures were in place and functional. In the future, I would use automated security detection tools and conduct regular security audits to assess vulnerabilities and prioritize mitigation strategies effectively.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

After refactoring the code, I conducted functional testing to ensure the software application operated as intended. Additionally, I ran OWASP Dependency-Check Maven to identify any new vulnerabilities that may have appeared during the refactoring process.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

I used Java Keytool for certificate generation, OWASP Dependency-Check Maven for vulnerability testing, and industry-standard best practices for secure coding. These tools and practices will greatly help me with future assignments and ensuring security measures are in compliance with security standards.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I would show future employers my ability to identify and address security vulnerabilities, implement encryption algorithms, deploy secure communication protocols, and conduct thorough functional testing. I would also show that I am proficient in using industry-standard best practices to ensure software security.
